In the terminal --> change to the folder where the file 'project.py' is located. (This is crucial because the path is used for storing graphs and data.)

Run the script with >> python3 project.py

After the program is finished, the last policy evaluation is shown and the plots for training and test rewards.
The GIF has to be edited manually (yet).

The plots and all intermediate policy evaluation plots are stored in the 'result' folder of the corresponding experiment.

Feel free to play around with the hyperparameters. (Some of them are not of use and relicts of the past)

In general the CODE IS STILL MESSY, but I will take care of it.

There are 2 result folders with liors code (LiorsCode1) and nicos code (First_Working_Test0).
(Liors code can be found in /temp/lior. The code is just extended by the HeatMapPlotter class)

It could be, that it might not work for you, because of the os.path-stuff. But it should :D
