Nico:

Exercise 1 (13+3 hours):
- Bellman part quite easy. Just use the formula.
- MDP/MRP task was good for understanding.
- In general, the exercise sheet conception is excellent.
- Problem formulation for the MDP/MRP part was somtimes confusing. Especially Task 1c).

Lecture 2 (4 hours):
- Really had to look up the mathematical definitions to be absolute clear what David meant.

Meeting (1.5 hours):
- More time should be used on the exercises.

General
- Flipped classroom concept works out nicely.
- Splitting tasks between teachers benefits a lot.
- Kahoot is cool, but takes a lot of time. Somehow you are forced to answer with time pressure which is a good exercise



Hendrik:

Exercise 1 (12+8 hours):
- Task1: subtasks a) and b) were good to understand and pretty much straightforward but I did not manage to solve c) and the following subtasks on my own.
- Task 2: good and well-structured task
- 1c) was very confusing for me with the path cost expression and I did not know, what value is wanted here
