Nico:

Exercise 2 (2 hour):
- I was sick from last tuesday on and had no energy for the assignment. 
- Plus, there was my sisters wedding on Friday (and Saturday), where I had to organize some stuff as best man.


Lecture 2 (3 hours):
- Just watched the lecture and took notes (but way too late)

Meeting (0 hours):
- Was on my sisters wedding on Friday. Missed the meeting :-(

General:
- It was really unfortunate for me, that nobody wrote a single thing in the Google Doc about last meeting.
- I get the feeling that I'm one of the few that are actually using this opportunity.
- Maybe the other students tend to use the Ilias forum if they have questions
- But at least for flipped classroom some kind of protocol should always be available.
